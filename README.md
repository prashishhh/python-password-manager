# Python Password Manager

A secure, command-line password manager built with Python.  
This project demonstrates the use of strong encryption, safe password input, and local encrypted file storage for personal account management.

## Features

- **Master password** protection and authentication
- Secure storage using **Fernet symmetric encryption**
- Key derivation via **PBKDF2-HMAC** with salt for added security
- Add and view multiple account credentials
- Sensitive files (`salt.key`, `passwords.dat`) excluded from version control
